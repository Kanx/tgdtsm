                            <p>If you have to constantly access your garage for something other than the car, for example to take bikes in and out, having to open up the whole door can be a pain. With symmetrical and non-symmetrical side-hinged doors, you can simply open up one side of the door and nip in and out in no time at all.</p>
                            <p>Side hinged doors come in many simple but stylish designs, and are ideal for locations where obstructions may be present within the garage that prevent the installation of other garage door types. The only thing you must consider when ordering a side hinged door is that you'll need to allow space at the front of the door for opening.</p>

	                         <p>Roller garage doors have become extremely popular due to their ability to succeed where other garage doors fail. For example, if you have a short driveway, a narrow or arched entrance, or a garage that opens directly onto a road, we wouldn't recommend an up and over door because it would protrude when you open or close it.</p>
	                         <p>However, with a roller garage door you have no such worries. Instead, the vertical roller garage door curtain is installed behind the garage opening and tightly coils up around a drum. And as roller garage doors can be installed without a frame you enjoy maximum drive-through use of the entrance in terms of both height and width.</p>
	                         <p>Operation is smooth, light and simple, and can be further enhanced by the addition of a remote control system, which allows you to open and close the door from the comfort of your car. This gives you added security and safety to put your mind at ease.</p>
	                         <p>Our range includes the popular Hormann RollMatic garage doors, as well as various other brands.</p>
	                         <p>The roller doors in our range are manufactured from either insulated aluminium or Plastisol coated steel, and come in a wide range of colour options, providing a smart but low maintenance finish.</p>
