The Garage Door Team fitters all have vast experience in fitting and repairing garage doors, and will be happy to provide you with advice and costs for all options.</p>
          <p>With the complex mechanisms involved in electrical garage doors, repairs can be commonplace.

		<h2 class="title" id="automation">Garage Door <span class="heavy blue">Automation</span></h2>
		<p>A wide range of accessories are available from The Garage Door Team to enhance the performance of your new garage door.</p>
		<p>Many customers choose remote control for the added convenience of operating their garage doors from the comfort of their vehicles. This option is most often appreciated during the winter months !</p>
		<p>Some of the older types of heavier doors can now benefit from automation making it so much easier to operate rather than opening the door on your own.</p>
		<p>Other accessories include Digital Keyless Entry Pads, Exterior Emergency Release Kits, Electric Key Switches and Infra Red Beam Breakers for added peace of mind.</p>
		<p>When it comes to garage doors, your personal safety and the security of your property are always at the forefront of our thinking. That's why nearly all of our doors come with an automation option.</p>
		<p>Automation allows you to open and close your garage door with a remote control, from the comfort of your vehicle - great for those wet and windy days, and perfect for those dark nights.</p>
		<p>When you open the garage door the courtesy light comes on, so you can see your surroundings clearly. Then to exit the garage, you either use the wall mounted control button or click your remote.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				There's a manual over-ride in the event of a power cut.
			</li>
			<li>The remote control has anti-cloning protection so no one will be able to 'clone' your remote and open your garage.</li>
			<li>There is a safety system to detect and warn you of any obstruction.</li>
			<li>The systems we install are very quiet.</li>
			<li>All of our systems operate on very low running costs.</li>
